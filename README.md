# GNSS Time Converter

GNSS time is calculated in `week` and `time of week`. Starting at 06.01.1980 at 00:00:00 with week and time of week being 0.
The offset to UTC was +/-0 which increased over time according to [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS-Zeit).

The Unix time stamp of that time is `315964800` which started at  `01.01.1970 at 00:00:00`.
